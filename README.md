# toDoodles
this is a to-do app, fully custom created app adopting old and new technologies showcasing my variety of skills and ability to take existing apps and update them adn take them to a whole new level.

this is a to-do Lsit app, it consists of 5 screens, the premise of the app is to create a main task and have 3 sub tasks to it. The app has a history view to track all of the completed tasks and it also has an analytics view to compare the completed to pending tasks.

Technologies and techniques I learned and used in this course:
  1. Diffable Data Source
  2. CollectionViews
  3. TableViews
  4. Parent - Child VC's
  5. Sublcassing
  6. Protocols and Delegates
  7. Safari Services
  8. Date formating
  9. Threading and Concurrency
  10. MVC architecture model
  11. Tab Controlller
  12. Navigation Controller
  13. write clean and well documented code while keeping consistency
  14. adjust elements to fit on all screen sizes
  15. Light and dark mode
  16. Empty state views
  17. custom alerts
  18. Compositional Layout
  19. third party Libraries
  20. Notifications
  21. Core Data
  
  things left to accomplish:
  1. configure notifcations
  2. improvements to core data
  3. refactoring some small pieces of code for better readability and less clutter
  4. other minor bug fixes
